# Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis

### Project Description : This is a project where I leveraged my NLP skills to perform Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis, based on secondary source data for Applus IDIADA. 

This repository consists of files for a Flask app that does Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis.

This app performs Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis using the **`TextBlob`** library of Python. This project especially focuses on 6 different aspects of a car. They are the following : 
* Performance
* Steering
* Stability
* ADAS System
* Comfort 
* Fun feel

The final output is a table that contains the polarities and sentiments of each of the 6 aspects mentioned above. There are 3 sentiments : 
* Positive
* Neutral
* Negative

This can be especially useful to gather sentiments from car reviews. 

## Usage
1) Run the flask server locally or adopt it to cloud. 
2) Enter some text in the input field on the home page.
3) Click on the **"Submit"** button.

The application will perform sentiment analysis on the text and show the results on the result page.
